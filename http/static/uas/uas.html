    <div>If you have installed channels manually before installing WebTools, you can click on the "Migrate manually/previously installed channels" to make WebTools aware of them.</div>
    <div>You can also search for updates for all installed channels managed by WebTools via the "Check for updates for all installed channels" button.</div>
    <div>Category names contain installed/total available channels.</div>
